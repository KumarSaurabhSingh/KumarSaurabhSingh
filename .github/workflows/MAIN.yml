### **ðŸ›  Fixes Applied**
1. **Removed extra dash (`-`) at the beginning of the file.** That was causing the syntax error.
2. **Fixed incorrect indentation** that might have caused parsing issues.
3. **Fixed incorrect parameters under the `with:` section**  
   - Your previous version used:
     ```yaml
     gif_out_path: dist/github-contribution-grid-snake.gif
     svg_out_path: dist/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg
     ```
     The correct syntax is:
     ```yaml
     outputs: |
       dist/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg
       dist/github-contribution-grid-snake.gif
     ```
4. **Updated GitHub Pages Deployment Step**
   - Your original workflow tried to push to `master`, which might not be the correct target.
   - The fix makes sure it pushes to the **"output" branch**.

3. Commit and push the changes.
4. Run the workflow manually from **GitHub Actions** in your repo.
5. After the workflow runs successfully, open:
